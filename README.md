# Pokédex app, GO!

This app was designed with HTML, CSS, and ES6+ JavaScript for the average, working trainer who needs a simple, portable Pokédex for their quest to catch 'em all! I built it throughout the intro to JavaScript course of my CareerFoundry bootcamp.

## Features

- We took a functional programming approach, and _initially_ did as much in JavaScript over HTML as possible to practice and learn (before implementing Bootstrap).
- Loaded data from the RESTful Pokémon API: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Polyfills:

  - Fetch
  - Promise

- The trainer/user can:
  - View all 150 Pokémon
  - Search/filter for a specific Pokémon
  - Click on a Pokémon for a modal pop-up to show important information needed to aid them as they battle and capture it.

## Dependencies

This Pokédex app relies on [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/). I created a fully functional app, then, in the final section, had to rework everything to utilize some of Bootstrap's features and components (such as modals).
