# Pokédex app, GO!
![01 Pokémon Index - search_edited](https://github.com/thisjunghyewon/pokedex/assets/120668221/e1070110-a3fe-4d62-98a4-81fd8358d74b)

In this project, I built a simple client-side application that uses JavaScript to interact with an external API. The responsive app displays a list of 150 Pokémon from a database. Users can search for a Pokémon by name and click on each Pokémon to open a modal with more information about its size, type, and image.

## Features
1.   Load data from an external source (API): https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
2.   Viewing list of items (Pokémon list)
3.   On user action
     -  Modal/Popup: Click the button to view more information about the selected Pokémon, including its height, type, and frontal image.
      - Search box: Enter the name of the Pokémon to see a filtered list of list items.
     
## Technical requirements
1. The Project follows the rules of ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint.
2. The app works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11 (by incorporating Polyfills for fetch and promise)
  
## Purpose of this project
Gaining experience integrating data from external third-party APIs and to see the benefits of using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap classes.

This Pokédex app relies on [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/). I created a fully functional app, then, in the final section, had to rework everything to utilize some of Bootstrap's features and components (such as modals).
